# dinnr
_by Isaac Miller_

This is the demo/companion app for my talk "Uncanny, Vuex Man!" which debuted at [Develop Denver 2019](https://developdenver.org/). The talk is an introduction to state management concepts and how those concepts play out within Vuex. 

This app leverages the Zomato API to create a "Tinder for Restaurants!". I know, it's cheesey (pun intended) but I created it to provide simple examples relevant to many applications including asynchonous processes, basic auth, and collection management. Maybe next time I'll try a DoorDash for Animal Rescues.
